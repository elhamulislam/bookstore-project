00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:34.699
Elham Islam: Hello! This is a hump! What's up? And this is for the extra credit

2
00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:36.550
Elham Islam: assignment.

3
00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:39.730
Elham Islam: So.

4
00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:43.960
Elham Islam: to begin with, we'll start with our app dot Java file.

5
00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:52.850
Elham Islam: Here we import. To begin with, we import our inventory pricing, and a few subclasses

6
00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:54.150
Elham Islam: or

7
00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.920
Elham Islam: book pricing pen, pricing pencil, pricing and stationery, pricing

8
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:08.590
Elham Islam:  The app class is the same, has not been

9
00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:19.060
Elham Islam:  in the public main polystatic main main function. We have

10
00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:25.099
Elham Islam: our inventory. That's an instance which is still the same, and

11
00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.289
Elham Islam: here we have our

12
00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.680
Elham Islam: 4 different pricing instances.

13
00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:40.609
Elham Islam: where we define book pricing, stationery, pricing, pen, pricing, and pencil, pricing as new book pricing.

14
00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.459
Elham Islam: stationary pricing and pencil pencil, pricing

15
00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.170
Elham Islam: as they are all different subclasses.

16
00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.590
Elham Islam: We then have changed our sales instance here.

17
00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:01.950
Elham Islam: and we call our sales constructor, but this time we pass inventory

18
00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:07.299
Elham Islam: book pricing, stationery, pricing, and pricing pencil, pricing all as arguments.

19
00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:16.490
Elham Islam:  the rent statements are the same, except here

20
00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:22.520
Elham Islam: we have our book pricing dot get price that has been changed

21
00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.669
Elham Islam: from before as

22
00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:34.809
Elham Islam: this time. We're directly getting it from the book, pricing. subclass. and the same for

23
00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:39.150
Elham Islam: stationary, pricing pencil, pricing and and pricing

24
00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.500
make sales. or the same ex

25
00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.230
Elham Islam: I mean.

26
00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.869
Elham Islam: make sales are the same

27
00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.709
Elham Islam: passive object, still the same. Okay.

28
00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:08.240
Elham Islam: let's now look at our pricing dot Java

29
00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:13.150
Elham Islam: as our inventory dot Java class is still the same.

30
00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.969
We'll look at our pricing Java.

31
00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:21.530
Elham Islam: as you can see. It's way less than what it was.

32
00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.110
Elham Islam: We have our public abstract class pricing.

33
00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.800
Elham Islam: We declare our private double price variable

34
00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:40.620
Elham Islam: as a part of our class, and our instructor method here public pricing

35
00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.570
Elham Islam: double and has argument double price

36
00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:51.139
Elham Islam: which sets the price for the class as the price we take from the argument.

37
00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:56.810
Elham Islam: We also have the get price method. which returns

38
00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:00.479
Elham Islam: our price that we have set

39
00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:04.840
Elham Islam: to this specific class in

40
00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:06.930
Elham Islam: the constructor.

41
00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.909
Elham Islam: So then, let's look at our

42
00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:20.180
Elham Islam: sub classes start with book pricing dot Java. They're all very similar. So here we import our

43
00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:21.679
Elham Islam: pricing class

44
00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:30.920
Elham Islam: and our public class book pricing extends from our pricing class. So it has all the

45
00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:38.930
Elham Islam: all the things we have in a pricing. We have the same in both pricing, except here we have

46
00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:46.120
Elham Islam: public or constructor or book pricing constructor, which calls the super method

47
00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:50.149
Elham Islam: which uses our

48
00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:55.690
Elham Islam: which basically calls our parent constructor here.

49
00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:01.780
Elham Islam: So it passes 10.0 as the price

50
00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:07.830
Elham Islam: as an argument, and that goes into our pricing dot Java here

51
00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:13.519
Elham Islam: as our argument, and then our prices set as the 10 point. Oh.

52
00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:20.719
Elham Islam: the same applies for pencil, pricing, pen, pricing, and stationary pricing.

53
00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:26.340
Elham Islam: Let's now look at our sales, Java, and see what's changed.

54
00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:33.720
Elham Islam: This time we, similar to our main function

55
00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:36.240
Elham Islam: or app dot Java.

56
00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:44.500
Elham Islam: We initialize all our different pricing here, book pricing, stationery, pricing, pen, pricing, and pencil pricing.

57
00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:46.410
Elham Islam: We then

58
00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:52.149
Elham Islam: and it. We then initialize our method define our method.

59
00:05:53.340 --> 00:06:00.009
Elham Islam: inventory. pricing, book, pricing, station, pricing, pen, pricing, and pencil pricing.

60
00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:05.670
Elham Islam: We then set all our all of our variables here.

61
00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:08.750
Elham Islam: 2. All the arguments that we get.

62
00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:12.520
Elham Islam: and then

63
00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:16.239
Elham Islam: we have our make sale.

64
00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:28.319
Elham Islam: which is similar, except this time we have used book pricing dot get price. which returns the price of our book

65
00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:44.149
Elham Islam: as we saw in our pricing dot. Java get price here. Calls that function calls that method same for stationery, pen and pencil returns false if it doesn't exist.

66
00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:46.630
Elham Islam: And

67
00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:50.879
Elham Islam: this card is the same.

68
00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:57.190
Elham Islam: Let's now look at our sales. Calendar, Java.

69
00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:01.929
Elham Islam: It's also the same.

70
00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:04.770
Elham Islam: Okay.

71
00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:08.359
Elham Islam:  that should be

72
00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:12.149
Elham Islam: everything that I changed for

73
00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:18.140
Elham Islam: the extra pet is. Let's let's run it and see what happens.

74
00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:37.280
Elham Islam: Yep, so as we can see.

75
00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:45.149
Elham Islam: starts the project available prices

76
00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:47.419
Elham Islam: as we know it.

77
00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:55.100
Elham Islam: sales transaction. True? True, everything's looks good.

78
00:07:56.050 --> 00:07:57.040
So

79
00:07:57.420 --> 00:08:00.550
Elham Islam: yeah, the subclass lives work.

80
00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:04.260
Elham Islam: Yeah.

81
00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:06.169
Elham Islam: thank you.
