00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:11.120
Elham Islam: Hello! My name's Aha, and today we'll be looking at an explanation for our bookstore project.

2
00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.219
Elham Islam: To begin with, we import our inventory pricing and sales classes.

3
00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.770
Elham Islam: We then have our

4
00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:28.029
Elham Islam: for the pap class, which is only to output starting project at the beginning of our output.

5
00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.420
Elham Islam: and we move into our main function

6
00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.319
Elham Islam: where we have that

7
00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.830
Elham Islam: Apco. and then we have are

8
00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:50.309
Elham Islam: initialization where we create an instance of inventory to manage our inventory

9
00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:55.299
Elham Islam: and pricing to handle all the inventory pricing

10
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.119
Elham Islam: and our sales.

11
00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.879
Elham Islam: which has arguments for inventory and pricing

12
00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.790
Elham Islam: which is used to create. To make our sales transactions.

13
00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.719
Elham Islam: We then move into our first print

14
00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:22.869
Elham Islam: our first print statement. Here we have a percentage sign.

15
00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:28.480
Elham Islam: dash 15 s. What that does is it outputs

16
00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.299
Elham Islam: a string for that s right there

17
00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:33.730
Elham Islam: and

18
00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:39.210
Elham Islam: then places 15 spaces before another string can be outputted.

19
00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:47.779
Elham Islam: So here we have 3, 3 times press and dash 15 s.

20
00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.450
Elham Islam: We have that 3 times and a percent end, which is a new line.

21
00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.650
Elham Islam: Then we have our arguments, product, availability and price.

22
00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.339
Elham Islam: These 3 strings go in, go into

23
00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:17.499
Elham Islam: the small S's. We have here all respectively. So product would go first availability and then price. and there would be 15 spaces after product before availability, and then 15 place spaces after availability, and then price.

24
00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.169
Elham Islam: Then we have all of our

25
00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:24.840
Elham Islam: been Fs for

26
00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.790
Elham Islam: for our items.

27
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.460
Elham Islam: Here we have something different. Our point 2

28
00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.630
Elham Islam: point 2 in our formatting. which

29
00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.790
Elham Islam:  which will mean that it outputs

30
00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:46.700
Elham Islam: a decimal tube.

31
00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:51.289
Elham Islam: The 2 decimal place or output the double to 2 decimal place

32
00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:56.409
Elham Islam: and our arguments. Here is the string books.

33
00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:03.820
Elham Islam: and then we call our we call inventory.is available, which returns a Boolean value.

34
00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.420
Elham Islam: true or false. If

35
00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:12.109
Elham Islam:  well, there is available method

36
00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:13.720
Elham Islam: as

37
00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.940
Elham Islam: the product, type and quantity as

38
00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:21.750
Elham Islam: as arguments. and then returns is available. If

39
00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:31.879
Elham Islam: that many that quantity of that product type is available and sure false is then outputted into

40
00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:33.490
Elham Islam: our string. Here

41
00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:42.250
Elham Islam: we then have pricing dot get price product type the argument product type voc.

42
00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:47.590
Elham Islam: and it returns the double vari value for

43
00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.099
Elham Islam: the price of a book.

44
00:03:50.510 --> 00:04:02.360
Elham Islam: and it also outputs that in 2 decimal places in our output. and that it does that for books, stationery, pencils, and pens.

45
00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:11.180
Elham Islam: Then we moved in to are sales transactions.

46
00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:14.469
Elham Islam: We have.

47
00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:17.859
Elham Islam:  we have a Boolean book sell

48
00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:19.880
Elham Islam: initialized here.

49
00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:23.660
Elham Islam: which sets the value sets.

50
00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:38.129
Elham Islam: which sets the value true or false. and calls sales dot makesale. which passes product, type, and quantity as arguments.

51
00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:41.529
Elham Islam: and it will return, true or false, if

52
00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:44.200
Elham Islam: the sale can be made, considering

53
00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:45.680
Elham Islam: If

54
00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:53.910
Elham Islam: there are enough inventory according to the quantity past

55
00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:57.370
Elham Islam: for the specific product type.

56
00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:08.960
Elham Islam: and then it stores that true or false value in book sale. So we then output are transactions. Sold 2 books.

57
00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:14.529
Elham Islam:  If if it's true, then it will say true. If it's false

58
00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:22.239
Elham Islam: and there aren't enough stock or inventory, it will return false, and then it will output false too.

59
00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:27.290
Elham Islam: and it does the same for book pencil and stationery.

60
00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:32.850
Elham Islam: We then have.

61
00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:38.659
Elham Islam:  We then have our print

62
00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:40.930
Elham Islam: an output statement for

63
00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:47.589
Elham Islam: class of sales, objects which basically outputs are

64
00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:53.370
Elham Islam: class name. Here we have sales. Dot getclass, get simple name.

65
00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:59.389
Elham Islam: If we only had get class here, would it would output bookstore dot sales dot sales

66
00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:05.979
Elham Islam: as the class name is sales, and our in our office name is also sales.

67
00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:08.120
Elham Islam: But

68
00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:23.470
Elham Islam: that's pretty long. So that's why we've used get simple name here, which will return just the class name which is sales. And then the system outputs exiting the program.

69
00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:29.440
Elham Islam: Let's now move in to our inventory. Bio.

70
00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:50.890
Elham Islam: Here we have to begin with, in our inventory class. We define all our variables, book, stock, stationery, stock, pencil, stock, and pen stock as private as they will only be used inside our inventory class.

71
00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:55.090
Elham Islam: They're all set t010-20-3040, respectively.

72
00:06:55.830 --> 00:07:01.310
Elham Islam:  yeah. And and we move into our

73
00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:07.820
Elham Islam: first method. In this class, which is is available. It has

74
00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:13.049
Elham Islam: the arguments for string, product, type and quantity, and in quantity.

75
00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:18.410
Elham Islam:  it uses a switch case

76
00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:24.129
Elham Islam: for all the different product types and returns true or false.

77
00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:26.050
Elham Islam: If

78
00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:35.749
Elham Islam: if our stock we have is greater than or equal to the quantity requested in the main function.

79
00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:43.590
Elham Islam: and that does the same for books, stationery, pencil, and pen. It also returns false

80
00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:46.160
Elham Islam: if we don't have enough stock.

81
00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:50.730
Elham Islam: as the quantity requested for the quantity requested.

82
00:07:51.910 --> 00:07:55.780
Elham Islam: We then have our second method, decrement stock.

83
00:07:57.330 --> 00:08:10.929
Elham Islam: which also has the class which also has the arguments string product type and in quantity. and it also uses the switch case for all the different types of product.

84
00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:19.249
Elham Islam: and it will decrement the stock, according to whatever quantity is passed through our main function.

85
00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:27.520
Elham Islam: Let's now look at our pricing class.

86
00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:35.280
Elham Islam: To begin with, we have all our

87
00:08:35.419 --> 00:08:39.870
Elham Islam: definitions or initializations here, where we

88
00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:53.510
Elham Islam: find our book price, stationery, price, pencil, price and pen price as double and private as it's the same as inventory. We. It will only be used in our class.

89
00:08:54.530 --> 00:09:02.000
Elham Islam: So they're all set to their respective prices here. And then we have our only method in this class.

90
00:09:02.890 --> 00:09:07.750
Elham Islam: get price with a class with an argument product type.

91
00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:15.980
Elham Islam: It also uses switch case similar to our inventory methods and

92
00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:19.689
Elham Islam: for each product type. It will return

93
00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:23.090
Elham Islam: their respective book prices.

94
00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:30.370
Elham Islam: and it will also return 0 if the product is not

95
00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:34.740
Elham Islam: one of. If if the product type isn't what we have

96
00:09:38.090 --> 00:09:48.130
Elham Islam: cut. let's now move into sales. Java. Our sales. Class. Here we import our inventory and pricing.

97
00:09:54.490 --> 00:10:00.860
Elham Islam: Here we import our inventory and pricing classes as they will be used in our sales. Class

98
00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:09.860
Elham Islam:  to begin with, we we call instances for inventory and pricing.

99
00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:15.560
Elham Islam: as like, I said, they will be. You lose in in my class

100
00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:18.409
Elham Islam: and the constructor.

101
00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:24.080
Elham Islam: We have our constructor here, which has arguments for inventory and pricing.

102
00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:29.030
Elham Islam: as they are required to make sale

103
00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:31.840
Elham Islam: to make transactions.

104
00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:37.260
Elham Islam: We use this inventory as our

105
00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:44.179
Elham Islam: inventory name, in our instance, is the same as that passed as an argument.

106
00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:47.759
Elham Islam: so we could differentiate. So the code can differentiate.

107
00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:53.080
Elham Islam: Then we have our make sale class make sale method.

108
00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:57.449
Elham Islam: which has the class

109
00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:03.320
Elham Islam: which has the arguments, string, product, type and integer quantity.

110
00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:06.059
Elham Islam: We start with

111
00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:14.610
Elham Islam: initializing our price or double price and set it to pricing dot get price.

112
00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:18.749
Elham Islam: which also has product type. As an argument. So.

113
00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.280
Elham Islam: looking back at our pricing

114
00:11:23.490 --> 00:11:30.259
Elham Islam: it will pass whatever product type we have. and return its respective price.

115
00:11:30.390 --> 00:11:34.339
Elham Islam: and it sets that to our local variable price here.

116
00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:38.459
and we have our boogie is available

117
00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:48.059
Elham Islam: which is set to true or false. according to our inventory.is available function that we call here.

118
00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:53.709
Elham Islam: and it passes the product, type and quantity as

119
00:11:53.900 --> 00:12:01.869
Elham Islam: arguments, so it will check width is available, and then return true, false, which will be set

120
00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:09.730
Elham Islam: to our local Boolean variable is available. We then have a conditional statement, if is available.

121
00:12:10.050 --> 00:12:10.900
Elham Islam: True.

122
00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:17.890
Elham Islam: then, inventory will decrement stock. As we are making a sale

123
00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:23.910
Elham Islam: the stock will decrease. So we call our inventory dot decrement stock function of method

124
00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:28.860
Elham Islam: and pass our product, type and quantity food.

125
00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:33.699
Elham Islam: and it will decrement stock. As we saw in our inventory class.

126
00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:44.509
Elham Islam: We then have our new. a different. A different class sales counter. dot, update, update total sales

127
00:12:44.610 --> 00:12:55.270
Elham Islam: which passes price times quantity as an argument and salescounter update total units. and which also passes out quantity as an argument.

128
00:12:56.380 --> 00:12:59.029
Elham Islam: These calls are used to.

129
00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:03.100
Elham Islam: as the name suggests, update our total sales

130
00:13:03.170 --> 00:13:06.229
Elham Islam: and update our total units sold.

131
00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:12.630
Elham Islam: and then it returns. True as we made as we have made. The sale.

132
00:13:12.650 --> 00:13:18.130
Elham Islam: if is available, is false. then we return false as we couldn't make our sale.

133
00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:23.340
Elham Islam: Let's look at our sales counter class that we have.

134
00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:35.190
Elham Islam:  we initialize public static variables here. One of them being double total sales

135
00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:41.560
Elham Islam: and integer total items. These 2 variables are static as they are

136
00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:50.200
Elham Islam: use to count our total sales and total items sold for all books, stationary pens, or pencils.

137
00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:54.290
Elham Islam:  it's not used for

138
00:13:54.540 --> 00:14:02.780
Elham Islam: it's not used for specific objects. It's used for all of our product types. That's why it's static

139
00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:08.549
Elham Islam: public static void update total sales with our

140
00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:10.809
Elham Islam: argument as double value.

141
00:14:12.170 --> 00:14:14.830
Elham Islam: This is used to

142
00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:24.210
Elham Islam: update our total sales, it's initially set to 0. But whenever a sale is made, as we saw in our sales dot Java class.

143
00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:30.839
Elham Islam: the value will be passed through to this class. To this method, and our total sales

144
00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:32.649
Elham Islam: will be summed

145
00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:35.750
Elham Islam: with our value here

146
00:14:37.310 --> 00:14:39.740
Elham Islam: a value will be added to total sales.

147
00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:42.730
Elham Islam: and we have our

148
00:14:42.750 --> 00:14:44.260
Elham Islam: public psych

149
00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:47.200
Elham Islam: void update tool units method.

150
00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:51.350
Elham Islam: which also has his value as an argument.

151
00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:52.940
Elham Islam: and it adds.

152
00:14:53.590 --> 00:15:00.469
Elham Islam: it adds, whatever quantity is sold into our total items, which is also initially set to 0,

153
00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:08.590
Elham Islam: and both these methods are static, as they need to be tracked throughout the code for all of our product types. And not only.

154
00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:10.070
Elham Islam: for example, book.

155
00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:15.230
Elham Islam: And then

156
00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:19.879
Elham Islam: here, for example, for another example, we have

157
00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:24.199
Elham Islam: another line like 46, where it says.

158
00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:33.550
Elham Islam: Print statement for total sales and an argument used here is sales counter and total sales.

159
00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:43.739
Elham Islam: We haven't used any other object to to output that total sales we have. We've called the sales counter directly.

160
00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:48.610
Elham Islam: and that returns our total sales that we have here.

161
00:15:48.650 --> 00:15:54.319
Elham Islam: which would be updated according to all these make sales we've made.

162
00:15:56.630 --> 00:15:59.389
Elham Islam: And yeah. that should be. It.
