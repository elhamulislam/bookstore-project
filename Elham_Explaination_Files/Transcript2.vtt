00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:09.050
Hello! I'm Elong, and we'll be. I'll be explaining the Bookstore project here.

2
00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:12.290
Elham Islam: to begin with, in our

3
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.910
the Java file.

4
00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:15.380
Elham Islam: We

5
00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:21.089
Elham Islam: first import all our packages, such as inventory, pricing and sales.

6
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.239
Elham Islam:  When enter classes

7
00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:30.160
Elham Islam: in our app class, we first have a method.

8
00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.880
Elham Islam:  that returns a string starting project

9
00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:41.179
Elham Islam: which we use in our main function to output

10
00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.710
Elham Islam: before our maincode is output it.

11
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:52.979
Elham Islam: First, we initialize all our instances, such as inventory pricing and sales.

12
00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:00.909
Elham Islam: If for our sales we have 2 arguments, such as inventory and pricing.

13
00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:08.070
Elham Islam: which is required for its constructor and for the sales for the and to

14
00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.499
Elham Islam: process all our transactions

15
00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:18.220
Elham Islam: in our header. Output statement, we have percentage

16
00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.860
Elham Islam: dash 15 s.

17
00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:24.269
Elham Islam: 3 times. The S here stands for a string.

18
00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.440
Elham Islam: and the 15

19
00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.110
Elham Islam: 15

20
00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.329
Elham Islam: is the amount of spaces after our string is on the screen.

21
00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:46.780
Elham Islam: and the arguments, product, availability and price are all strings that go into the little S's respectively, and our percentage. N stands for new line.

22
00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:55.870
Elham Islam: Similarly, we display all our inventory and pricing. For for example, for books.

23
00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.150
Elham Islam: we have

24
00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.299
Elham Islam:  where our strings are books and inventory dot

25
00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:19.890
Elham Islam: is available. That's a call to our is available. Funk is available method in inventory, and our inventory class. which returns to true or false. If the book, and if if the product and its quantity is available.

26
00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.350
Elham Islam: it takes 2 arguments, string and quantity.

27
00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.559
Elham Islam: This the string and integer product, type and quantity.

28
00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:45.440
Elham Islam:  pricing and get price pricing dot get price, which which returns our price for this specific product. And we pass that product

29
00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.099
Elham Islam: into our get price method as an argument.

30
00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.979
Elham Islam: and all of those, all the 3 strings

31
00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.999
Elham Islam: and all the 2 strings and the double

32
00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.870
Elham Islam: outputs. according to this format

33
00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:09.330
Elham Islam: and the point 2. Here is for 2 decimal places. The double will output as

34
00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.370
Elham Islam: we then have our sales transactions. our Boolean.

35
00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.520
Elham Islam: We have a Boolean function. I'm sorry. A Boolean

36
00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:27.700
Elham Islam: variable booksell which is set to sales. Dot makesale, and we call make sale here. which has

37
00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:38.140
Elham Islam: arguments, product, type, arguments, string and integer product, type and its quantity. which returns true or false. If the sale has been made.

38
00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.960
Elham Islam: the same goes for

39
00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.880
Elham Islam: pencil sale and stationary sale.

40
00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:48.820
Elham Islam: we then

41
00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:59.229
Elham Islam: sit. We then have our output for

42
00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:13.080
Elham Islam: to display our class, so class of sales object and then outputs our string sales, and then we call, get class function, which returns the runtime name of our sales class.

43
00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:18.949
Elham Islam: But then we also call the get simple name

44
00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:23.520
Elham Islam: method, which is a part of the class

45
00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:24.670
Elham Islam: class

46
00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.200
Elham Islam:  and that

47
00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:34.230
Elham Islam: gives us a simpler name as get class method would give us

48
00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:42.149
Elham Islam: book store project, thought sales dot sales, whereas Getsimple name will just give us the class name, which is sales.

49
00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:46.449
Elham Islam: And then we have our exiting the program

50
00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:51.880
Elham Islam: output. Let's move into our inventory

51
00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.619
Elham Islam: in inventory. We have all our

52
00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:06.899
Elham Islam: variables initialized as private integers. Book, stock, stationery, stock, pencil, stock and pen stock.

53
00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:11.789
Elham Islam: They're all private as we're using them. Only in this class.

54
00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:16.600
Elham Islam: Then we have our method.

55
00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:28.770
Elham Islam: Boolean is available. Which returns a true or false value and has arguments, string, product, type and integer quantity.

56
00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:34.380
Elham Islam: This use, this method uses a switch case where

57
00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:38.579
Elham Islam: it checks the product type.

58
00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:45.080
Elham Islam: and if it's if it matches with either book, stationary pencil, or pen, it checks. If the stock

59
00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:48.320
Elham Islam: that we have here is greater

60
00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:52.379
Elham Islam: then, or equals to the quantity required.

61
00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:57.830
Elham Islam: If it is, it will return true. otherwise

62
00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:01.180
Elham Islam:  it will return false.

63
00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:14.500
Elham Islam: Then we have our decrement stock method. which also has this string product, type and integer quantity. As arguments. This also uses a switch case

64
00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:23.769
Elham Islam: and it decreases the quantity decreases the stock according to the quantity it's it's been given.

65
00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:26.639
Elham Islam: Let's now move it into pricing.

66
00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:30.220
Elham Islam: In pricing. We have

67
00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:33.389
Elham Islam: all our variables initialized here

68
00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:35.919
Elham Islam: as private in double

69
00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:40.160
Elham Islam:  We have our book price.

70
00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:43.650
Elham Islam: stationary price, pencil price and pent price.

71
00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:49.469
Elham Islam: We also have our method. Double get price.

72
00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:58.059
Elham Islam: which returns the price of the product and the product is given to this method as an argument.

73
00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:01.569
Elham Islam: and the method uses a switch case

74
00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:03.910
Elham Islam: and

75
00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:11.519
Elham Islam: it checks which product it. which product has been passed through as an argument and returns its price

76
00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:21.249
Elham Islam: as it's been and initialized in our function in our method. Now let's see our sales dot Java

77
00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:29.270
Elham Islam: in our sales. Java, we first import our packages, booked inventory, and pricing classes.

78
00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:42.320
Elham Islam: then we also initialize are instances, inventory and pricing as they are required to do our sales transactions. So

79
00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:46.600
Elham Islam: in our constructor. we first

80
00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:52.050
Elham Islam: set our class in, and our initialized

81
00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:56.270
Elham Islam: instances of inventory pricing that we made in our sales class

82
00:07:56.530 --> 00:08:02.810
Elham Islam: and set it to the inventory and pricing we got as an argument from our main function.

83
00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:07.460
Elham Islam: then, in our Boolean make sale

84
00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:15.379
Elham Islam: method. It has 2 arguments. product, type and quantity.

85
00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:18.940
Elham Islam: and firstly, it sets the price

86
00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:20.210
Elham Islam: as

87
00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:29.480
Elham Islam:  It sets the price to pricing getprice and calls the getpice function here.

88
00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:35.989
Elham Islam: which also passes. Product type has its argument.

89
00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:48.330
Elham Islam: We then have Boolean is available. We then initialize the mean. It is available to inventory.is available and call the is available function

90
00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:54.120
Elham Islam: which returns true or false. If that product is available.

91
00:08:54.360 --> 00:09:00.660
Elham Islam: we then have a conditional statement. If is available. True. then inventory.

92
00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:02.950
Elham Islam: and then

93
00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:06.099
Elham Islam: we call the decrement stock method.

94
00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:10.320
Elham Islam: which will decrease the stock according to the quantity and its product.

95
00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:17.450
Elham Islam: We then have our sales counter, dot update total sales

96
00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:18.930
Elham Islam: method

97
00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:23.670
Elham Islam: which has price times quantity as its argument

98
00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:28.270
and sales dot counter update total units

99
00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:31.599
Elham Islam: which has quantity as its argument.

100
00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:35.270
Elham Islam: These 2 updates are sales.

101
00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:36.840
Elham Islam: Connor.

102
00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:42.850
Elham Islam: updates to total sales made in terms of pricing and our total units

103
00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:45.650
Elham Islam: sold in terms of inventory.

104
00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:47.760
Elham Islam: So

105
00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:51.910
Elham Islam: let's move to our sales counter Java.

106
00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:57.880
Elham Islam: Here we can further understand what this sales counter class does.

107
00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:05.410
Elham Islam: We first initialize our total sales and total items as static.

108
00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:10.239
Elham Islam: double and static in. This is because we're using static because

109
00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:23.460
Elham Islam: we will be needing to update these 2 values. whether it be book. stationary, pen or pencil, it doesn't matter. But and we'll have to update this

110
00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:28.500
Elham Islam: for all of them, and not just book or not just stationery.

111
00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:35.859
Elham Islam: Similarly, we have public static void update, total sales

112
00:10:36.490 --> 00:10:38.809
Elham Islam: which has the argument value.

113
00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:47.259
Elham Islam: It updates our total sales and adds the argument value into total sales

114
00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:49.130
Elham Islam: is also static.

115
00:10:53.890 --> 00:10:55.790
Elham Islam: as it can be called.

116
00:10:56.810 --> 00:10:59.869
Elham Islam: without creating an object

117
00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:04.049
Elham Islam: similarly, public static, void of the toll units.

118
00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:13.879
Elham Islam: Also, as an argument value and total items is incremented according to the value sold.

119
00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:19.459
Elham Islam: Let's look at this

120
00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:21.120
Elham Islam: line of code here

121
00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:30.199
Elham Islam: system dot out.

122
00:11:47.650 --> 00:11:49.380
Elham Islam: This line

123
00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:54.359
Elham Islam: outputs are total sales.

124
00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:58.540
Elham Islam: and it call calls or sales counter dot total sales.

125
00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:14.339
Elham Islam: and notice how we did not create an instance for sales counter. like we did for inventory pricing and sales. That's where the static comes in. We can. We can just call total sales and output it like that

126
00:12:14.510 --> 00:12:15.410
Elham Islam: as it

127
00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:19.220
Elham Islam: as it follows all throughout our main function.

128
00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:22.329
Elham Islam: And yeah.

129
00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:29.899
Elham Islam: also notice how we separated our classes to different folders.

130
00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:36.190
Elham Islam: Here we have inventory pricing and sales as different folders. This helps

131
00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:39.619
Elham Islam: with our code organization.

132
00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:43.180
Elham Islam: which is an advantage and encapsulation.

133
00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:45.540
Yeah.

134
00:12:46.210 --> 00:12:47.790
Elham Islam: that's it. Thank you.
